# ATPia - Health & Nutrition App

A React Native app built with Expo Router and NativeWind for health tracking and nutrition management.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Welcome, Register, Login screens
- **AI Chatbot**: Powered by OpenRouter API with real-time streaming
- **Health Tracking**: Progress tracking and analytics
- **Nutrition**: Diet calculator and meal plans
- **Social**: Community features and forums

## Environment Setup

### For AI Chatbot

1. Get an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Update the `HTTP-Referer` in `features/ai/services/streamApi.tsx` to your app's URL

### Android Emulator Recommendations

For optimal streaming performance with OpenRouter.ai, we recommend:

#### **Recommended Emulators:**
- **Pixel 9** (API 34/35) - Best performance for streaming
- **Pixel 8 Pro** (API 34) - Excellent compatibility
- **Galaxy S24** (API 34) - Good performance
- **Pixel 7a** (API 33) - Reliable streaming

#### **Avoid These Emulators:**
- **Pixel 5** (API 30) - May have streaming issues
- **Older API versions** (API < 30) - Limited streaming support
- **Low-end devices** - May struggle with real-time updates

#### **Why These Recommendations:**
1. **Better Network Stack**: Newer API versions have improved HTTP/2 and streaming support
2. **Memory Management**: More RAM available for handling streaming connections
3. **JavaScript Engine**: V8 improvements in newer Android versions
4. **Fetch API**: Better native support for streaming responses

### Implementation Details

The AI chatbot uses a **fetch-based streaming approach** instead of Server-Sent Events (SSE) for better compatibility:

#### **Key Features:**
- âœ… **Native Fetch API**: Uses React Native's built-in fetch with ReadableStream
- âœ… **AbortController**: Proper connection cleanup and cancellation
- âœ… **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues
- âœ… **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of streaming connections
- âœ… **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently on both Android and iOS

#### **Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Uses native fetch with ReadableStream
const response = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { /* ... */ },
  body: JSON.stringify({ /* ... */ }),
  signal: abortController.signal, // For cancellation
});

const reader = response.body.getReader();
// Process streaming data chunk by chunk
```

#### **Benefits Over SSE:**
- ðŸ”¥ **Better Android Compatibility**: Works on all Android emulators
- ðŸ”¥ **No External Dependencies**: Uses native APIs only
- ðŸ”¥ **Better Error Handling**: More predictable error scenarios
- ðŸ”¥ **Memory Efficient**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- ðŸ”¥ **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety throughout

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
